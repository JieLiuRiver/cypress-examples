
1. **Promise-handling Tests:**
   - *Description:* Cypress seamlessly handles promise-returning functions in tests.
   - *Example:* Using `reverseString` function and returning the promise for assertion.

2. **Async/Await in Tests:**
   - *Description:* Cypress supports async/await syntax for handling promises in tests.
   - *Example:* Employing `async/await` for the `reverseString` function.

3. **Fixture Loading and Chaining:**
   - *Description:* Cypress automatically handles fixture loading, and commands within the chain wait for completion.
   - *Example:* Loading text from a fixture file, trimming it, reversing it with `reverseString`, and asserting the result.

4. **Using Cypress Commands in Tests:**
   - *Description:* Cypress commands in tests automatically make the test asynchronous, waiting for all commands to finish.
   - *Example:* Chaining Cypress commands (`cy.wrap` and `should`) to double a string.

5. **Wrapping Promise-returning Functions:**
   - *Description:* Using `cy.wrap` to handle promise-returning functions, ensuring Cypress waits for their resolution.
   - *Example:* Wrapping `twice` function and asserting the result.

6. **Sequential Execution of Promises:**
   - *Description:* Controlling the order of execution for promise-returning functions using `cy.then`.
   - *Example:* Chaining promises sequentially and asserting their results.
